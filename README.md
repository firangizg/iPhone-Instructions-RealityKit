# iPhone-Instructions-RealityKit
This AR app is my submission to Neural Hacks Hackathon 2020. The app is made to provide instructions on iPhones for seniors to eliminate the gender gap in technology usage. It is one of the lesser known diversity issues that can be addressed with awareness. Even though the app only provides limited instructions on limited device types, it can be expanded upon.

Not all the code in these files are needed, however, recommended. Latest versions of XCode and Reality Composer is needed. 

The devices uploaded are not my design, however, the texts and callouts are mine.
